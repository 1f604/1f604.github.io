SimpleBlogPage is a mediawiki extension developed by 1f604 based on BlogPage.

I couldn't figure out how to upload my extension to mediawiki so I uploaded it here on my github. 

This page exists in order to get my github repository to show up on Google search results (Google apparently doesn't index Github repositories consistently) since I wrote on the mediawiki page that people can find it by googling it and it would look pretty bad if they couldn't find it on google.
