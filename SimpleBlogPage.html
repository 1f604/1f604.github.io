<p>SimpleBlogPage is a mediawiki extension developed by 1f604 based on BlogPage. </p>

<p>Mediawiki link: <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SimpleBlogPage">https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SimpleBlogPage</a></p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t figure out how to upload my extension to mediawiki so I uploaded it here on my github. </p>

<p>This page exists in order to get my github repository to show up on Google search results (Google apparently doesn&#39;t index Github repositories consistently) since I wrote on the mediawiki page that people can find it by googling it and it would look pretty bad if they couldn&#39;t find it on google. </p>
